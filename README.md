# Minor - Real Time Web

## Introduction
In this project I'm going to build a real time web application. I'm going to make a
website that visually represents a real-time data source. Nowadays people expect websites
to be real-time. Think about al the social media platforms. When someone posts something, you want
to see it immediately. Just like whatsapp, when someone sends you a message, you want to see it
directly, you don't want to wait around for multiple seconds.

This is why real-time is very popular right now. It's fast and more importantly, it's what people
expect, and as a frontend developer this is what should trigger you.

## Live Link
The live chat can be found on the following link: <br/>
[Live Chatroom with Socket.io](https://minor-realtimeweb.herokuapp.com/)

## What did I make
For this project we worked with socket.io. I made a chat app, working with socket.io.
First I made the basics of a chat app. Online people can send a chat to other online people.
After that I added some features, such as, styling for the chat.
Also I checked if the message was send by yourself or by someone else, so I could style the
messages. What is send by yourself will be on the right side of the screen. And the received
messages will be on the left.

Also each message contains the username, and a day and time of when the message was send.

## Features
-	Live Chat
-	Usernames
-	Day and Time per message
-	Styling, depending if send by you or someone else
-	Autoscrolling

## Wishes
-	I want to add a notification when someone enters the chat
-	I want to work with a database eventually, so you can upload pictures, maybe a login with chatrooms.
	So every user can have access to different chatrooms.
